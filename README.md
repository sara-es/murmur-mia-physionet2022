## Model and hyperparameter description

09. Super-ensemble of CNNs + gradient boosting + gboost for murmur outliers, using *weighted* logistic regression to set thresholds; 2-stage gradient boosting for outcomes (with num recordings, heart rates features)

**Models used:**
  * outlier_detector_murmur: gradient boosing on recording features, number of recordings, and heart rates 
  * rubin_cnn_ensemble: 5 CNNs trained on murmur targets, ensembled using a NN
  * linear regression to combine above, with positive weights on Present (5) and Unknown (3) labels
  * outlier_detector_outcome: gradient boosting on recording features, number of recordings, and heart rates
  * gb_outcome: gradient boosting on outcomes

**recording_to_murmur_predictions thresholds**
  * OUTLIER_THRESHOLD = 0.9
  * PRESENT_THRESHOLD = 0.4
  * ABSENT_THRESHOLD = 0.6
  * POS_VETO_THRESHOLD = 0.62

**recording_to_outcome_predictions thresholds**
  * MOD_OUTCOME_THRESHOLD = .68
  * OUTL_OUTCOME_THRESHOLD = .7
